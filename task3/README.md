# Program input

The program requires a path to a json file as an argument. The examples can be
found in the [`inputs/task3`](../inputs/task3) directory. Following those 
examples new inputs can be created. The algorithm is implemented by the 
`SystemNode` struct, in its impl block the `iterate` function can be found which
is the entrypoint to the implementation on each iteration of a simulation.
