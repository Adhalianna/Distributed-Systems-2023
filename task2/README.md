# Program input

The program accepts optionally a path (relative or absolute) to a file in the
json format which describes the scenario (nodes and duration of tasks in ms)
that should be played. If no input is given a simulation with 10 nodes running
tasks of random duration will be played. The example inputs can be found in the
[`inputs/task2`](../inputs/task2) directory.
